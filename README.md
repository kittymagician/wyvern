## The Story
wyvern was developed as a weekend project to try and "push the boundries" of what's possible with automation of passive DNS with OpenAI.

## OpenAI
\*Please note: OpenAI support is extremely buggy. The data that is being presented to wyvern is buggy at best. It is not a replacement for an analyst.
